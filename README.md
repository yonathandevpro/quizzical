# Quizzical

Quizzical is a simple web application built with React that allows users to test their knowledge with a set of quiz questions fetched from an external API.

## Features

- Fetches quiz questions from the Open Trivia Database API.
- Randomizes the order of questions and choices for each quiz session.
- Allows users to select answers for each question.
- Provides feedback on the correctness of selected answers.
- Displays the total score after completing the quiz.
- Supports responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quizzical.git

2. Navigate to the project directory

    ```bash
    cd quizzical
3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install

4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
5. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

I recommend you to use vite to work in React, here is How you can do it:
  ```bash
  npm create vite@latest
  npm install && npm run dev
  ```
Now, the program will automatically open on http://localhost:5173/

## Usage

- Upon loading the application, users are presented with a start page where they can click on the "Start Quiz" button to begin.
- Once the quiz starts, users can answer each question by selecting one of the multiple-choice options provided.
- After answering all the questions, users can click on the "Check Answers" button to see their score.
- Users can click on the "Play again" button to restart the quiz and try to improve their score.
